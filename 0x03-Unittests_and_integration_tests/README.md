# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests
Alx project to demonstrate how to write unit and integration tests using the python unit testing framework and mock object library.
- Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs.
- Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures

## Requirements
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- All your classes should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the - length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
